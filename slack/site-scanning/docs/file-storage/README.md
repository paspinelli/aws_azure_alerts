This folder is for some temporary storage needs.  

The `TTS_Software_and_Systems_Inventory_Subdomains.csv` and `federalist-websites.csv` files were previously in the `/domains/` folder as part of earlier efforts to scan subdomains.  Moving them back there would cause them to be added to the list of target URLSs.
